# On-Chain Analytics and Documentation

I built this repository to keep a clear, traceable record of how I study Bitcoin, analyze market structure, and document portfolio decisions across multiple chains. None the less, I wanted a space where every update shows my reasoning, the tools I used, and what I learned while tracking price action and macro shifts over time.

## Purpose

I noticed that my research was scattered across messages, charts, and quick notes. I made sure this repo becomes the single place where I document BTC analysis, multi-asset evaluations, sentiment tracking, and on-chain behavior so I can revisit my thinking and refine my approach. With that being said, this is designed for long-term clarity, not short bursts of commentary.

### BTC Analysis

I focus on structure first, then momentum, then liquidity. I learned that this flow keeps me grounded when volatility spikes, so I set up folders for daily, weekly, and long-term tracking.

### Macro Studies

I track DXY, yields, inflation, and global liquidity because I noticed that these variables explain why the market trends even when charts look irrational. Thus, this directory holds the context behind every directional bias I record.

### Sentiment Tracking

I treat sentiment as a confirming signal. I store news cycles, derivatives behavior, and social narratives here so I can compare emotion versus data.

### Portfolio Documentation

I log positions, adjustments, and thought processes. I strive to build habits around documenting why I enter or exit instead of relying on memory.

### Task Management

I separate operational work from analysis so I can review what I completed and what I still need to automate or refine.

## How I Use This Repository

I open the date-stamped files, review previous thinking, and update the next entry with what changed and why. I noticed that this pattern makes my research consistent and helps me avoid emotional decision-making.

## Naming Conventions

```
YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md
```

Examples:

```
2025-02-01-btc-daily-analysis.md
2025-02-01-portfolio-update.md
```

## Contribution Guidelines

I maintain this repo alone. I keep each entry dated, source-backed when possible, and separated by domain so the flow stays clear.
